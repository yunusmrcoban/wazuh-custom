## Integration of Azure Devops on Wazuh

With the integration of **Azure Devops** , which are modular structures on Wazuh, a custom script and rules were created. “AzureDevops” has been added to the beginning of each key value due to the dynamic values in the filebeat fields. For example: “AzureDevops.ActorUPN”.
I recommend you to edit the level of the rules.
